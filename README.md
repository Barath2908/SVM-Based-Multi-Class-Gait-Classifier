# SVM-Based-Multi-Class-Gait-Classifier
Description:
This project introduces a robust system for classifying six gait phases in real-time using accelerometer and gyroscope data from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). Our work encompasses a variety of cutting-edge techniques to enhance gait phase classification accuracy.

Key Achievements:

1. Algorithm Variety: We've developed and tested over 15 real-time algorithms to accurately identify gait phases based on IMU data, ensuring a comprehensive exploration of different approaches.

2. Fine Gaussian SVM Multiclassifier: The project incorporates a Fine Gaussian Support Vector Machine (SVM) multiclassifier, optimized with 5-fold cross-validation. This method yielded a high accuracy of 90.5% for gait phase classification.

3. Robust Performance: Our system consistently achieves an average True Positive Rate (TPR) of 95.4% with a low False Positive Rate (FPR) when evaluated using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. This robust performance ensures reliable gait phase classification.

4. Innovative Architectures: We propose three novel IMU-SVM-based Gait Phase Classification Architectures. These architectures achieve an impressive accuracy of 93.45% with minimal variance (Â±1.49%) in the R-squared (R2) metric, demonstrating the reliability and consistency of our classification system.
